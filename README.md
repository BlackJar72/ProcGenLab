# ProcGenLab

A simple tool for testing, prototyping, and experimenting with procedural content generation.  It will allow any system which produces or can readily be reprented as a tile map or sort of time map to be tested visually, tweaked, and profiled independed 
a game (or similar).  Systems can be hacked in within the generators package in an IDE or written with the jar link as a 
dependency / library and then loaded into the gui at run time.

Actual documentation comming soon.
