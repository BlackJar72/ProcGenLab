# ProcGenLab

A failed experiment.  Supposedly a GUI framework for for experimenting and prototyping with in procedural content generation, or at least map generation.  However, I can't get it to load user created jars.  Anyway, done -- may find some use with its in-IDE hacking method -- but not something I'd want to publicize and actively distribute.  Failure, and only begs the question, "Why do I put myself through this?"
