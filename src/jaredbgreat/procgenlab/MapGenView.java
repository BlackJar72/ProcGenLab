 * A program for procedure content generation experiments concerning world /
 * campaign maps.  This is an application for holding re-usable visualization 
 * code along with various map generation systems that plug into it so as to 
 * allow experimentation and development of map generators that can be used
 * else where.  The first likely use of one of these would most likely be a
 * Minecraft mod (RPG Campaign Mod) so as to see it in action in a real game 
 * without creating the whole game.
